<h1>Alameda Watershed Center Parallel Audio Experience - <br>
Testbed for basic web content</h1>

Linked below is the catalog of what will eventually be 8 different immersive audio experiences made available to 
  visitors through QR codes visible on each installation in the museum. These audio experiences are intended to 
  enhance the immersive quality of materials presented, while also making a parallel experience available 
  to those with vision impairment.
