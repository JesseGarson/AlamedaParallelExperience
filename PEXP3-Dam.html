<h1>Calaveras Dam Today</h1>
</p>
<div id="audio-text" aria-hidden="true">
<p>

Lets take a whirlwind tour through time and space, and into the heart of one of California's engineering marvels, the impressive Calaveras Dam.
</p><p>
Imagine the sounds of the 1900s when the original Calaveras Dam and Reservoir were constructed. At 230 feet, it stood as the highest earth- fill dam in the world
</p><p>
Water flows into Calaveras Reservoir from three sources:  Calaveras Creek, Arroyo Hondo, and water diverted from upper Alameda Creek diversion dam. More on that in a moment.
</p><p>
Prior to the 1960’s water made it way from the reservoir to the city through remarkable conduit known as the Niles Canyon Aqueduct. A vital lifeline in it’s day, now lies overgrown and almost forgotten,
</p><p>
Today, water flows swiftly and efficiently through the modern Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, delivering an essential supply to communities across the region.
</p><p>
Do you hear that sound? You would if you were a steelhead making your way past the diversion dam through the fish ladder.
</p><p>
A fish ladder is a unique system designed to assist fish in navigating and overcoming obstaclesduring their upstream migration.
</p><p>
Adult steelhead navigate a 32-foot climb, alternating between swimming, jumping and resting in a series of cascades and pools. It's a remarkable journey of resilience and determination that can take a day or more to reach the top, granting them access to spawning grounds for nest- building and egg-laying.
</p><p>
The fish ladder, dam and reservoir system stand as a harmonious convergence of human engineering and the resilience of nature.
