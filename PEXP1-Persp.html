Letâ€™s take a journey through the mosaic of habitats that make up the Alameda Creek Watershed.
</p><p>
The Visitors Center stands near the historic Sunol Water Temple. Listen closely and you can hear the water as it trickles down the interior walls of the temple and into the pool below. This is one small part of the energy of the watershed all around you.
</p><p>
The Watershed Discovery Garden beckons with its vibrant flowers, buzzing bees, and fluttering butterflies. Explore the tactile elements of garden and learn about various habitats and plant communities found in the region. The nearby Ruupaywa art installation
captures the essence of the watersheds mosaic in a colorful sculpture made from reclaimed and recycled materials.
</p><p>
But it's Alameda Creek that defines the mosaic's pattern, flowing through the watershed like a life-giving artery. It is a key element to this working watershed. As water
travels through the area, it picks up sediment, nutrients, and pollutants, all of which play a role in shaping the mosaic's colors.
</p><p>
Wetlands and forests in the watershed act as natural filters, providing a habitat for wildlife while also purifying the water. They're home to a symphony of sounds, from the chirping of birds to the croaking of frogs.
</p><p>
But human activities, like urbanization and agriculture, can alter the flow of water and introduce pollutants. The sound of a tractor in the distance and a car honking remind us that the watershed is not immune to the effects of development.
</p><p>
That's why watershed management strategies, like erosion control and conservation practices, are critical to the health of the watershed. It's up to all of us to protect this precious resource.
